I was helping move for this past weekend so I haven't been able to work on it since then but before this session started I was looking more into exactly what the project 3 directions are asking. So I think I understand more about the structure of what this project is. I will first start with creating and inserting with the index file.

## During Session | End of Day Thoughts:

So far I've been able to create the basic layout of main. I just finished making the extension check. While its not a great function I know how it works so thats that. Wasn't able to work on insert but its been because I've been thinking about how exactly to insert? I understand the concept given at the bottom of the project assignment but I guess how exactly do I format that in .idx. I guess I am a bit confused still. I'll ask about it later.
