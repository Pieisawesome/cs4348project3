I was helping move for this past weekend so I haven't been able to work on it since then but before this session started I was looking more into exactly what the project 3 directions are asking. So I think I understand more about the structure of what this project is. I will first start with creating and inserting with the index file.

So far I've been able to create the basic layout of main. I just finished making the extension check. While its not a great function I know how it works so thats that. Wasn't able to work on insert but its been because I've been thinking about how exactly to insert? I understand the concept given at the bottom of the project assignment but I guess how exactly do I format that in .idx. I guess I am a bit confused still. I'll ask about it later.

Start of a new work day. Will be working on insert and how exactly I want it to work? I'm not still but I have some ideas of how to go about this. I guess most of the start of this session will be figuring that part out. Hoping to figure that out then work on the next functions/implementations.

I think I understand how index file works now. Its 512 bytes so I have to change my inputs to a format that can fit that. Currently working on implementing header and keys. Also what is this magic number? Is it supposed to be random?

I DONT WANNA WORK ON THIS. I've been procasting so much cause I want summer break to be here. Pain. Oh well. Time to finish this project. Today will be finishing this project as much as I can cause its due today. Main segments/parts I'll be working in. Finishing up insert, Working on print (I feel like this one will be easier), extract (if I have insert done and know where to find the keys then extracting from a file and inserting it into other shouldnt be too bad), ... So I'll work on finishing up insert for now.
